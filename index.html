        <h1>Why I like coding?</h1>
        <h2>Most of the things we use are electrical appliances. For example, during these covid times we most of the times use laptop. In our laptop we use some apps. We use zoom to attend webinars. We use google to search something. We use whatsapp to send messages to our friends. We use G Mail to mail someone. These are only some of the apps we use in our day to day life. There are millions of apps like this. I thought, how are these apps made. Can I make them? then I learnt coding. Coding is the thing which lies in the backround of all apps. Apps change this world a better place to live. In other words, coding makes this world a better place to live. Do you want to be one of the person who changed this world a better place to live. If you want to become one of them, just start coding! </h2>
